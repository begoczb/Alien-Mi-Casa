# Alien Mi Casa

_by: Begonia Calzado_

## What is it?

This is a game I made as my first project after joining the Web Development IRONHACK bootcamp.

## What was the goal?

The goal was to make a "race car" like game that would run and deploy in a browser. All made with HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT.

## Why this one?

I would like to say it was after a lot of thinking but it would be a lie, the Alien going home just popped in my head and I thought it would be cool so I just went for it!
The title takes after the movie quote _Mi casa, tel√©fono - ET_.

## Features

- A very cute alien.
- Challenging difficulty
- LOTS of randomness
- Multiple canvas animations

## Issues

- Phantom collisions some times.
- Alien and/or balloons not loading properly on first load/restart.
